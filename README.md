# remarkable-templates

My templates and a little script to help manage them on the Remarkable.

## Setup

Run `mise install` with [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/). Alternatively, look at
`.tool-versions` and install the specified tools.`

## Usage

Go to `Settings/About/Copyrights and licences` and find the IP address at the bottom.

Then run `./manage.sh` to Backup/Restore/Sync/SSH into the Remarkable using that IP.
